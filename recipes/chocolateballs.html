        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <h4>For Salty Chocolate Balls</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a stick of butter, cubed, into a the bowl of a stand mixer with 2 cups of sugar, and mix on high for 2 minutes. Crack 3 whole eggs and cream together with the butter and sugar on a high speed until creamy.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine 1 cup of flour, ½ cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, and 1 ½ tsp each of baking powder and kosher salt. Whisk together before slowly adding to the mixture in the stand mixture on a low speed.</li>
            <li>As that comes together we’re going to add ½ tsp vanilla extract, ½ cup buttermilk, and ¼ cup vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Once those are added, turn mixer back on to a high speed for 2-3 minutes or until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Oil the inside of a cake pan, fill it with the cake batter, smooth out the top, and bake at 350°F for 35-40 minutes or until set and no longer jiggling.</li>
            <li>While cake cools, we’re going to melt 8 ounces of chocolate in a double boiler. Pour chocolate onto a sheet pan and spread it out until smooth. Freeze for 10 minutes or until it has lost its sheen.</li>
            <li>Use a lemon zester, scrape the chocolate off of the pan, creating some short and curly chocolate curls. Place in a bowl and toss with some cocoa powder. Place in freezer until we’re ready to use them.</li>
            <li>In the meantime we’re going to scrape our cooled cake into a mixing bowl. Adding ½ cup of whole milk, adding more milk if necessary until we reach a dough-y consistency. We will then shape them into chocolate balls and place on a parchment lined baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Coat balls in molten chocolate and roll in the bowl of chocolate curlies.</li>
        </ol>
