            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>4 Ounces Crumbled Goat Cheese</li>
            <li>1 Clove Garlic</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Creme Fraiche Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Pint Heavy Cream</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Buttermilk</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <h4>For Fritata</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a mandolin, shave ½ dozen shallots into ⅛ inch slices that we’re going to seperate into little rings.</li>
            <li>Pour some frying oil into a pot, and heat to 250°F. Place shallots in oil and raise the temp to 350°F. Remove when blonde. Not dark brown, but blonde.</li>
            <li>Chop up 3 large heirloom tomatoes, scooping out the seeds in the middle before chopping into 1 inch pieces.</li>
            <li>In a 10-inch cast iron pan, combine butter and olive oil and turn on a medium high heat.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine 6 eggs, 1 cup of milk, salt, pepper, and 4 ounces of crumbled goat cheese.</li>
            <li>Cook one small chopped shallot and 1 clove of garlic until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add heirloom tomatoes and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated or until tomatoes are soft</li>
            <li>Add egg and cheese mixture. Constantly run your wooden spoon across the bottom of the pan. This helps create a single curd and more tender eggs.</li>
            <li>Heat oven to 350°F.</li>
            <li>Once eggs become thick, place in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until eggs are completely set.</li>
            <li>Slice yourself a piece and top with fried shallots, chopped chives and creme fraiche.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>For Creme Fraiche</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 1 pint of heavy cream with 2 Tbsp of buttermilk. Stirring well to combine.</li>
            <li>Cover container that contains the creme fraiche and let it sit out overnight.</li>
        </ol>
